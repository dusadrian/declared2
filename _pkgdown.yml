     This package is in an early development phase. The current dataset S3 class is inherited
         from the base R data.frame. Later versions may change to the modern
         [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/), which carries a larger dependency footprint
         but easier to work with. Easy interoperability with the
         [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) package--which provides an Rinterface to the [DataTables](https://datatables.net/)
         JavaScript library---remains a top development priority.
